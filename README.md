Welcome to my Arkanoid game project, implemented in C++! This game is designed to work on both Ubuntu and Linux.

## 📝 Project Description
This repository contains the source code for a classic Arkanoid game. The game is a breakout clone where the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by destroying bricks while not allowing them to reach the bottom of the screen.

## 💻 Implementation
The game is implemented in C++, utilizing the power of object-oriented programming. The code is organized into several classes, each representing a different element of the game such as the paddle, the ball, and the bricks.
## 🔧Installation
To install the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arknoid-cpp.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd arknoid-cpp`
3. Compile the game using a C++ compiler: `g++ -o Arknoid main.cpp`

## 🛡️ Usage
To play the game, simply run the compiled executable: `./Arknoid`
