Welcome to my Arkanoid game project, implemented in C++! This game is designed to work on both Ubuntu and Linux.

## 📝 Project Description
This repository contains the source code for a classic Arkanoid game. The game is a breakout clone where the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by destroying bricks while not allowing them to reach the bottom of the screen.

## 💻 Implementation
The game is implemented in C++, utilizing the power of object-oriented programming. The code is organized into several classes, each representing a different element of the game such as the paddle, the ball, and the bricks.

## 🐧 Linux Compatibility
This game is designed to be compatible with Linux-based operating systems, including Ubuntu. It leverages the cross-platform capabilities of C++ and has been tested on both Ubuntu and Linux.

## 🚀 How to Run

Feel free to explore the code, raise issues, and submit pull requests. Let's bring this classic game to life with the power of C++! 🚀
